# safespace

SafeSpace filters your Twitter feed and searches for potentially negative, triggering content using the HP Haven OnDemand Sentiment APIs. Created by Justin Paulin (@interwho) and Cheng Peng (@chunky123) for YHack Fall 2015.

# Usage

Requires a basic LAMP stack to run - Verify API keys and MySQL credentials in config/Config.php. PHP 5.5.0 recommended.

# Common Issues

- If you're getting 404 responses on pages besides the index page, be sure you have "AllowOverride All" set in your Apache config.
